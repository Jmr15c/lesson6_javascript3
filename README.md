### Project Description:
The purpose of this assignment was to familiarize the student with the Browser Object Model system, and thus the Document Object Model system. These features were added into a simple photo gallery appication in order to add more user interactivity into the application, and to gain a better understanding of how the objects within a DOM functiona nd relate to one another.

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. While the Browser Object Model allows you to establish a large amount of objects within the code, not all object types are supported by every browser. For example - many browsers do no support the Navigator Object. However, most accept Window, Document, History and Location.
2. The Window object is also known as the global object, and is probably the most important. The window object represents a web browser window, hence all other objects are contained and inserted within the Window object. The total model, including the WIndow Object and every object placed within it, makes up the Browser Object Model system.
3. Dynamic HTML, or DHTML, is extremely helpful in web applications as it allows web content to change without requiring the entire web page to reload. This allows for quicker access and load times, as well as more sophisticated web pages, because it allows the presentation of information and content to change. The DHTML requires a conbination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to function.
